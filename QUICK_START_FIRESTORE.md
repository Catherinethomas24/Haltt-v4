# Quick Start: Firestore Wallet Storage

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

Automatic wallet address storage in Firebase Firestore when users connect their wallets.

## 📋 Quick Setup Checklist

### 1. Enable Firestore (5 minutes)
- [ ] Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- [ ] Select project: `haltt-c7632`
- [ ] Click **Firestore Database** → **Create Database**
- [ ] Choose **Test Mode** → Select location → **Enable**

### 2. Set Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{email} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email == email;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test It
```bash
npm start
```

1. Sign in with Google
2. Connect a wallet (Phantom/Solflare/MetaMask)
3. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → `users` collection
4. You should see your email with connected wallets!

## 📊 Database Structure

```
users (collection)
  └── user@example.com (document)
        ├── email: "user@example.com"
        ├── wallets: [
        │     {
        │       address: "ABC123...",
        │       type: "solana",
        │       name: "Phantom",
        │       connectedAt: Timestamp
        │     }
        │   ]
        ├── createdAt: Timestamp
        └── lastUpdated: Timestamp
```

## 🔄 How It Works

```
User Signs In → Document Created Automatically
     ↓
User Connects Wallet → Wallet Saved Automatically
     ↓
User Disconnects Wallet → Wallet Removed Automatically
```

**No extra user action required!**

## ✅ What to Look For

### Browser Console Messages:
- ✅ `New user document created for: [email]`
- ✅ `Wallet added successfully: [address]`
- ✅ `Wallet removed successfully: [address]`

### Firebase Console:
- Collection: `users`
- Document ID: Your email
- Field: `wallets` array with connected wallet data

## 🎯 Key Features

1. **Automatic Sync** - No manual save buttons
2. **Duplicate Prevention** - Same wallet won't be added twice
3. **Secure** - Users can only access their own data
4. **Real-time** - Updates immediately in Firestore

## 📁 Files Changed

- ✅ `src/firebase.js` - Enabled Firestore
- ✅ `src/services/walletService.js` - NEW file with all wallet functions
- ✅ `src/components/Dashboard.js` - Added auto-sync on connect/disconnect

## 🐛 Common Issues

**Problem:** Console errors
**Fix:** Check `FIRESTORE_WALLET_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed troubleshooting
