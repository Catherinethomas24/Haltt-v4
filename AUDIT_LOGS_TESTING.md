# Audit Logs Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Cursor Pointer Issue - SOLVED**
Added global CSS rules to make all interactive elements show pointer cursor:
- All buttons
- All links
- All clickable divs
- Tab navigation items
- Filter buttons
- Sidebar menu items

### 2. **Wallet Connection Detection - SOLVED**
Fixed the audit logs not showing by:
- Added fallback query mechanism (works without Firestore indexes)
- Improved error handling
- Added auto-refresh when tab becomes visible
- Fixed useEffect dependencies

### 3. **Empty State Issue - SOLVED**
The "Connect a wallet to start tracking activity" message will now:
- Disappear once you connect a wallet and logs are created
- Show actual logs after wallet connection
- Update in real-time

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Clear cached images and files
3. Close and reopen browser

### Step 2: Test Wallet Connection
1. Go to your app: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Sign in with Google
3. Click **"Add Wallet"** button
4. Connect your Phantom/Solflare wallet
5. **Wait 2-3 seconds** for Firestore to save

### Step 3: Check Audit Logs

2. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ A green entry: "Wallet Connected"
   - ‚úÖ Wallet name (e.g., "Phantom")
   - ‚úÖ Truncated wallet address
   - ‚úÖ Timestamp (e.g., "Just now")
   - ‚úÖ SOLANA badge

### Step 4: Test Disconnection
1. Go back to Dashboard
2. Click the trash icon on your connected wallet
3. Go to Audit Logs again
4. You should now see:
   - ‚úÖ Previous green "Connected" entry
   - ‚úÖ New red entry: "Wallet Disconnected"

### Step 5: Test Filters
1. Click **"Connected"** filter button
   - Should show only green connection entries
2. Click **"Disconnected"** filter button
   - Should show only red disconnection entries

- ‚úÖ "Add Wallet" button

- ‚úÖ Refresh button
- ‚úÖ Tab navigation (Balances/Transactions)
- ‚úÖ Wallet cards
- ‚úÖ Sign Out button

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: No logs appear after connecting wallet

**Solution 1: Check Firestore Rules**
Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
Ensure you have:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /auditLogs/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /users/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Solution 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any Firestore permission errors
4. If you see "Missing or insufficient permissions", update Firestore rules above

**Solution 3: Manual Test**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. Check if `auditLogs` collection exists
4. Check if documents are being created when you connect wallet

### Issue: Logs show but filters don't work

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Clear browser cache
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Cursor doesn't change to pointer

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Check if `index.css` changes were saved
- Restart dev server

## üìä Expected Behavior

### After Connecting 1 Wallet:
```
Statistics:
- Total Events: 1
- Connections: 1
- Disconnections: 0

Logs:
‚úÖ Wallet Connected
   Phantom ‚Ä¢ Az2a7t...hMyyi
   Just now
   [SOLANA]
```

### After Disconnecting That Wallet:
```
Statistics:
- Total Events: 2
- Connections: 1
- Disconnections: 1

Logs:
‚ùå Wallet Disconnected
   Phantom ‚Ä¢ Az2a7t...hMyyi
   Just now
   [SOLANA]

‚úÖ Wallet Connected
   Phantom ‚Ä¢ Az2a7t...hMyyi
   2 minutes ago
   [SOLANA]
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:
1. ‚úÖ All buttons show pointer cursor on hover
2. ‚úÖ Connecting wallet creates a log entry immediately
3. ‚úÖ Disconnecting wallet creates a log entry immediately
4. ‚úÖ Filters work correctly
5. ‚úÖ Timestamps update properly
6. ‚úÖ Statistics show correct counts
7. ‚úÖ Logs persist after page refresh
8. ‚úÖ No "Connect a wallet" message when logs exist

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

Once everything works:
1. Deploy Firestore indexes for better performance:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
   ```

2. Test with multiple wallets
3. Test after logging out and back in
4. Test after waiting several days (historical logs)

## üìù Notes

- **Fallback Mode**: The app now works WITHOUT Firestore indexes (slower but functional)
- **Index Mode**: After deploying indexes, queries will be much faster
- **Real-time**: Logs update when you switch tabs or refresh
- **Persistence**: All logs are permanently stored in Firestore
- **Privacy**: Each user only sees their own logs (filtered by userId)
